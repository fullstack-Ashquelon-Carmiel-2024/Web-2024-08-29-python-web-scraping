Optional Recursive part:

- Open all the levels of the bought sets and put them on the "shelves"
at home like: 5 bottles of red wine, 10 green apples, 3 martini glasses
(with the pictures)

function orderPurchasedItems(ar) {
    // if ar - is one layer array of the item objects - just put these objects
                                                        // on the shelves

    // if ar contains array inside, we will use orderPurchasedItems again
}

like 2 small red sets, 3 medium green combination
