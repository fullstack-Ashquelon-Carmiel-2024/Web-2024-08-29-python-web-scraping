step1: 1 disk - 1 action - start from moving to the 3rd tower 
     exiting condition

step2: 2 disks - 3 actions - start from moving to the 2nd tower

step3: 3 disks - 7 actions - start from moving to the 3rd tower

        move 2 disks to the 2nd tower - step2
        move the largest disk to the 3rd tower - step1
        move 2 disks to the 3rd tower - step2

step4: 4 disks - 15 actions - start from moving to the 2nd tower
 (from=0, help=1, to=2)


        move 3 disks to the 2nd tower - step3 (from=0, help=2, to=1)
        move the largest disk to the 3rd tower - step1 (from=0, help=1, to=2)
        move 3 disks to the 3rd tower - step3 (from=1, help=0, to=2)

NUMBER OF STEPS: previous number of steps * 2 + 1
