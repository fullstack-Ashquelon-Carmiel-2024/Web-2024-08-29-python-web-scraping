1. check that python is installed 

> python --version 

if it is installed, but not returns the version, then
it is not in the PATH variable

edit PATH and enter there the python.exe location

2. install pip 
> python -m pip install pip --upgrade

3. check what is installed globally

> pip list 

4. > cd <project dir>

Create virtual environment for our app:
> python -m venv .venv

5. To activate the virtual environment
in powershell
> ./.venv/Scripts/activate

in bash
> source ./.venv/Scripts/activate

(to get out from the environment:

> deactivate
)

6. Install pipenv:

> pip install pipenv

Check which virtual environment is activated now:

> pipenv --venv

If pipenv is not found install it globally:

> py -m pip install pipenv

or for the user globally

> pip install pipenv --user

7. > pip install flask

to check that it is installed
> pip list

8. application.py:

from flask import Flask

9. If vs code not seeing the environment, 
we shoud show it where is the current
python interpreter

Ctrl-Shift-P
Python: Select interpreter

+ browse to the interpreter at .venv/Scripts/python.exe

10. To save the environment:

> pip freeze > requirements.txt

(> makes redirection of the output into requirements.txt)

After that in some other place we can restore this environment:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Each time when we install smth we should run the "freeze"

to keep requirements.txt up to date, like

> pip install flask && pip freeze > requirements.txt
