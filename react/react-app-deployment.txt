1. For example you'd like to upload the homework "Counters"

2. So you create on the hosting directory panda/<your name>/projects/bulls-and-cows

3. Now you go to your React app package.json and add there
   the entry "homepage", like this:

   {
  "name": "counters",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "homepage": "https://panda.knowledger.guru/natalie/projects/bulls-and-cows",

4. If your app uses react router and starts not from the domain/subdomain

   root, you should to add basename to the BrowserRouter.

   Go to index.js and there add prop "basename" to BrowserRouter,

   like this:

   <BrowserRouter basename="/natalie/projects/bulls-and-cows">

5. In the terminal:

   $ cd react/bulls-and-cows

   (if there is no node_modules, run "npm i")

   $ npm run build

6. Now you've got directory "build" 

7. Use FTP client like Filezilla and copy the contents of
   your local "build" dir to "bulls-and-cows" dir on the hosting

8. Now check it in the browser at:

https://panda.knowledger.guru/<your name>/projects/bulls-and-cowss
