Passwordless Authentication Reduces Risk and Improves User Satisfaction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Passwordless Authentication strengthens security by eliminating 
risky password management practices and reducing attack vectors. 
It also improves user experiences by eliminating password and secrets fatigue. 
With Passwordless Authentication, there are no passwords to memorize 
or security question answers to remember. 

Passwordless authentication can be achieved in many ways. Here are a few:

-- Software tokens or certificates
-- Biometrics: Physical traits, like fingerprint or retina scans, 
   voice or facial recognition, and behavioral traits, like typing 
   and touch screen dynamics, are used to uniquely identify a person. 
   Even though modern AI has enabled hackers to spoof certain physical traits, 
   behavioral characteristics still remain extremely hard to fake.

-- Possession factors: Authentication via something that a user owns 
   or carries with them. For example, the code generated by 
   a smartphone authenticator app, OTPs received via SMS, or a hardware token,
   proximity badges, physical tokens, or USB devices (FIDO2-compliant keys)

-- A mobile phone application or other Multi-Factor Authentication solution, 
   where users are forced to provide multiple forms of evidence 
   to gain access to enterprise applications and systems

-- Magic links: The user enters their email address, and the system sends them 
   an email. The email contains a link, which when clicked, 
   grants access to the user.

    

The latest MFA solutions support adaptive authentication methods, 
using contextual information (location, time-of-day, IP address, device type, etc.) 
and business rules to determine which authentication factors 
to apply to a particular user in a specific situation. 
Adaptive MFA balances convenience with security. 
For example, an employee accessing an enterprise application 
from a trusted home computer might be required to provide only 
one form of authentication. But to access the application 
from a foreign country over an untrusted WiFi connection, 
the user might also have to enter an SMS code.

Passwordless Authentication Benefits
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Passwordless Authentication provides a variety of functional and business benefits. 
It helps:

-- Improve user experiences – by eliminating password and secrets fatigue, 
   and providing unified access to all applications and services.
-- Strengthen security – by eliminating risky password management techniques 
   and reducing credential theft and impersonation
-- Simplify IT operations – by eliminating the need to issue, secure, 
   rotate, reset, and manage passwords.


Is Passwordless Authentication Safe?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whether or not passwordless authentication is safe depends 
on your definition of safe. If safe means harder to crack 
and less prone to the most common cyberattacks, then yes, 
passwordless authentication is safe.

If by safe you mean, it is impervious to hacking, then no, it’s not safe. 
There’s no authentication system out there which can’t be hacked. 
Maybe there is no obvious way to hack it, but it doesn’t mean that 
the most sophisticated hackers can’t work their way around its defenses.

With that said, passwordless techniques are inherently safer than passwords. 
E.g., to hack a password-based system, a bad actor may use a dictionary attack, 
which is often considered the most rudimentary hacking technique 
(keep trying different passwords until you get a match).

Even the amateur hackers can perform a dictionary attack. Conversely, 
it takes a significantly higher level of hacking experience and sophistication 
to infiltrate a passwordless system. E.g., only the most advanced AI algorithms 
can enable a hacker to spoof a fingerprint.
